# Haiku Dada App

### [Haiku Dada App: Live Site](https://haiku-shift-app.now.sh/)

### Documentation

Haikus are poems with lines grouped by syllable, the most
popular form being 3 lines of 5 syllables, 7 syllables, and 5 syllables.

"Haiku Generator" logic controls the syllables and grammar rules for
each line.

Users can also view the "Collection" of previously created haikus.

Finally, by clicking "Haiku Shift", users can view a randomly generated haiku - based on the inputs of previous users.
