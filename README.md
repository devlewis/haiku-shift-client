# Haiku Dada App

### [Haiku Dada App: Live Site](https://haiku-shift-client.now.sh/)

### Documentation

Haikus are poems with lines grouped by syllable, the most
popular form being 3 lines of 5 syllables, 7 syllables, and 5 syllables.

Use the "Haiku Generator" to create a new haiku. Logic controls the syllables and grammar rules for
each line, based primarily on user's inputs. Optionally, users can save their haiku to the "Collection" either anonymously or with the user's choice of penname.

Users can view the "Collection" of previously created haikus.

Finally, by clicking "Haiku Shift", users can view a randomly generated haiku - based on the inputs of previous users.
